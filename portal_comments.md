## Cornerstone portal comments

### First Impressions
- I expected `All Inventory` to an unfiltered list of everything, complete or in process
- Map View option is nice.
  - Hovering over a state should show me more detail than just quantity
  - Names of items and a progress icon could be shown here
- Filters in the left sidebar are intuitive 
- `Search all` 
  - It is not clear how this is filtering. Typing the name of a form or state abbreviation does not filter properly
  - A fully functional Search Bar should be more prominently placed above the table
- Could "Jurisdiction" be replaced by "State"?
- I do not see a "Complete" status

### Suggestions
- Have a single table, that shows **everything** by default with a few tabs at the top for navigation
  - "All" tab, unfiltered view of all licenses, renewals, and applications. Status should be clear with text and icon
  - "In Process/Progress" tab for all Renewals or Applications currently in progress, but not completed. Use color, label, or icon to indicate if it is a renewal or application
  - "Bonds" tab, only shown if client has a bond managed by Cornerstone
  - Keep filter options in left sidebar
  - Heading above table should change based on tab, or be removed if tab label serves as heading
- `Changes` will behave like an inbox, or notifications. 
  - Changes box appears above main table
  - When there are no new changes, a history of all changes can be viewed by clicking an Inbox/History button
  - This should be the one of the first places clients look when checking the portal
  - After viewing and closing a change message/item, it is removed.
    - Opening items in the main table still shows a change history
    - users can see "read" change messages in their inbox/history
- Billing & Payments and Company Files should be in higher level page menu, not alongside the table
